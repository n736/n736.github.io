    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a passionate, creative individual with a diverse, interdisciplinary skill set. I'm interested in topics varying from researching artificial intelligence and
      generative algorithms in the field of music technology, video games, and human-computer interaction. My artistic style is interactive and improvisational, with a complexity so generalized, it breaches the boundary of possibility.

      An experimental design for a controller interface for controlling... well... anything! The current prototype includes 10 touch potentiometers connected via I2C to an Arduino Nano, able to transmit OpenSoundControl messages over a USB Serial connection. These potentiometers not only give visual feedback, but can programmatically have its position set, allowing for a complex, hands-free change between different scenes. Currently, a Max/MSP interface exists to easily allow hooking up these parameters to a fun sounding object like resonators~, perfect for controlling a gong with an attached transducer.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The physical design is currently being modeling for 3D printing for a final product.

      A glitchy, multi-channel composition revolved around the machine learning of a signal. Each networked performer draws waveforms, training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based on their inputs. As time progresses, the MLP learns each performer's signal identity and interpolates between them. The MLP output is played back through a buffer at a swept frequency from 0 to the sample rate, with lots of aliasing and self-modulation. The spectroscope of this signal is a work of art itself. And of course, there are fun little glitch noises every time you click send.

      A ghostly composition that takes you on a ride, deep beneath the earth. The piece was arranged in Audacity, using a couple of field-recorded sounds that were carefully transformed into a completely new atmosphere. The piece reveals the composer's interest in horror, a genre that always manages to evoke strong emotion and send chills down the spine.

    <h3>Language Is Music</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Read aloud a piece of text, which may be this one, at a slow, natural pace. At each word, enunciate each and every consonant and vowel. Focus on how each letter sounds, listening to the transient sounds of each consonant, the pitch of each vowel, and the rhythm of each and every syllable. After you finish reading this piece of text, you will repeat the piece of over and over, slightly changing your pronunciation with one of two possible variations:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style: number;">
        <li> 
          Emphasize the percussive-sounding consonants until your voice becomes nothing but a drum kit 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Elongate the vowels until you are singing or humming a melody
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Repeat the piece of text until there is no text to be heard, but only the music your vocal interpretation has created.
      </p>
    </div>

      An instruction score that sonically investigates the underlying musical elements of linguistics. Inspired by "I Am Sitting In A Room" by Alvin Lucier, the piece slowly transforms a simple piece of text into a form of pure sound. This piece has been designed with the composer's newly achieved understanding of sound, through Pauline Olivero's practice of deep listening. The score is featured in "A Year of Deep Listening" arranged by Stephanie Loveless.

    <p>A fun, guitar designed to run in the browser. A combination of data visualization techniques in JavaScript and an understanding of music, MIDI, and guitars. You can click each fret to play a melody or try chord mode, selecting each note to be part of a harmony. Or if you really just want to have fun, go to town in strum mode. Fun fact: I actually prefer to tune my guitar in all fourths from Eb; it just feels right. </p>

      A heartwarming, Christmas-time composition that shines light on a beautiful flower, unusually existing in a snowy environment. The composition style is like a multi-dimensional see-saw, bouncing between contrasting thoughts. The exploitation varies across musical constructs: major against minor, regular against irregular time, and loud against soft. Although the piece sounds uniquely satisfying, it is quite difficult to play as is, leaving room to reinterpretation through different arrangements and orchestrations.
